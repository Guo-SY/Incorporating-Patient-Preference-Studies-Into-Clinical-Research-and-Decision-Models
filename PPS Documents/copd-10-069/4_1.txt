Figure 1 Initial questionnaire on usage, effectiveness, inhalation technique, and overall satisfaction 8 weeks after switching from the HandiHaler to the Respimat inhaler. Notes: Question 1, Do you think that you can use Spiriva well? Question 2: What do you think about the effect of Spiriva on shortness of breath or dyspnea? Question 3: Please tell us about any difficulties you experienced when using each inhaler as follows: Q3-1, on inhalation technique; Q3-2, on breath-holding technique; Q3-3, on overall handling or usability. Question 5: Please tell us your overall satisfaction with Spiriva for each inhaler. The inhalation technique required for Respimat was significantly more difficult than that required for the HandiHaler (P=0.049, question 3-1), but there was no significant difference in the usage (question 1), perceived effect of the medication (question 2), breath-holding technique (question 3-2), or overall handling (question 3-3). Evaluations of the Respimat were classified as “good” or “bad” (question 5), but no significant difference was detected between the devices.
