Figure 4 The second questionnaire administered 2â€“3 years after switching from the HandiHaler to the Respimat, and comparison of responses to those in the first survey. Notes: Question 1: Do you think that you can use Spiriva well? Question 3: Please tell us about any difficulties you experienced when using each inhaler, as follows: Q3-2, on breath-holding technique; Q3-3, on overall handling or usability. Question 5: Please give us your overall satisfaction with Spiriva for each device. The usage (question 1), perceived breath-hold technique (question 3-2), overall handling (question 3-3), and overall satisfaction (question 5) with Respimat were significantly improved compared to the results of the first survey (P=0.0008, P=0.0017, P=0.031, and P=0.0086, respectively). The overall satisfaction with the HandiHaler was significantly worse in the second survey (P=0.0436, question 5).
