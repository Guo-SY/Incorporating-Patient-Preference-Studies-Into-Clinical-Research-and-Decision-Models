FIG. 2. Choice utility values derived for patients (with number of doses each day). Positive choice utility value for a given attribute level indicates a more desirable attribute, whereas a negative utility value of the attribute level indicates a less desirable attribute. For each attribute, the larger the spread from the highest to lowest utility values, the higher that attributeâ€™s importance.
