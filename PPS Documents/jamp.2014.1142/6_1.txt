FIG. 4. Choice utility values (with class and cost attributes) derived for HCPs in US, Europe, and Japan. A positive choice utility value for a given attribute level indicates a more desirable attribute, whereas a negative utility value of the attribute level indicates a less desirable attribute. For each attribute, the larger the spread from the highest to lowest utility values, the higher that attributeâ€™s importance. Of the 13 attributes, the importance of each attribute has been ranked for each country/region. EU, Europe; ICS, inhaled corticosteroids; JP, Japan; LABA, long-acting b agonist; LAMA, long-acting muscarinic antagonist; US, United States.
