Figure 1 Percentage of participants with ﬂawless inhaler technique performances (diamonds) and distribution of rate of wrong steps (boxes and whiskers). Footnote: Percentage of users with ﬂawless inhaler technique performances is repre- sented by the diamond symbol. Distribution of the rate of wrong steps (number of wrong steps O total number of steps; RWS) for the more frequently used devices. Box represents 25e75 percentiles and rectangle box the median. Whiskers represent 5 and 95 percentiles. Pearson chi-square test was used to test for statistical signiﬁcant differences in the per- centage of ﬂawless inhaler technique executions and Man- neWhittney U test was performed to test for statistically signiﬁcant differences in the RWS. * p Z 0.006 for Turbohaler vs Handihaler.
